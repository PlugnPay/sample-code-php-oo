<pre>3rd Party OO PHP API - 07/03/2008

**************************************************************************
** This code is NOT officially supported by Plug 'n Pay Technologies.   **
**************************************************************************

This community built, OO based PHP API, was originally written by Rich Bowen,
Director of Development at EAS Technologies LLC. & was released as a open-source
community project on Google Code.

The plugnpay-php project can be found on Google Code, at 
"http://code.google.com/p/plugnpay-php/".  As as of the initial release
there was a pretty through implementation of PlugnPay's API payment method
& related API modes.

API modes that were not explicitly implemented, can be implemented implicitly
with a __call method, so developers may call any API mode, documented or
undocumented, if they just pass it the right list of arguments.

Please refer to this project on Google Code for additional details & usage.

This 3rd party API should asset PHP developers, who wish to use OO based
code & do not wish to use/implement CURL.

The project on Google Code was relased as ASL2, so you can use it for any purpose,
commercial or non-commercial, and make any derivative works you like from it,
with attribution.


***** IMPORTANT NOTE *****
This code is NOT officially supported by Plug 'n Pay Technologies.  As such, this
module is being provided "AS IS".  If you have problems using/implimenting this
3rd party PHP API, please seek support assistance via this project's page on the
Google Code web site.
